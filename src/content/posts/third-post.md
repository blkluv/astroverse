# Revolutionizing Dispensary Product Launches with Dcommerce Drops

## Why Traditional Drops Fail Cannabis Brands

🛑 **Limited Reach**: 68% of dispensary product launches never break even  
💸 **No Secondary Market**: 100% of merch value disappears after purchase  
📍 **Location Confusion**: 45% of customers can't find limited drops  

> "We left $28,000 on the table with our last launch - until we switched to DISPO.SOCIAL Drops"

## How Our DCommerce Drops Work

DISPO.SOCIAL gamifies dispensary product drops by linking digital merchandise ("dmerch") to precise What3Words locations, termed "ZADDYs," for simplified in-store redemption. These drops incentivize customers to become "ZAFLUENCERS," who can resell dmerch as LUV NFTs via blockchain technology.

For example, a dispensary can launch a DISPO.SOCIAL Drop for a limited-edition product, offering it at 50% below retail price in cryptocurrency. This encourages immediate resale, with only one buyer eligible to claim the physical product in-store. This system allows dispensaries to back unique products with LUV NFTs, each tied to a specific What3Words ZADDY, enabling buyers to locate the physical merchandise. Customers can also resell the dmerch for a refund before claiming the physical item.

DISPO.SOCIAL collaborates with local micro-influencers and DJs to host these dispensary drops, fostering social gatherings where customers can trade, buy, and sell ZADDYs, facilitating networking and community building.

To promote livestream dvent drops, DISPO.SOCIAL utilizes paid ad campaigns across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and Google. The Wizard of Hahz's Google certification ensures that DISPO.SOCIAL's ads are less likely to be flagged compared to agencies without certified staff managing dispensary accounts.
