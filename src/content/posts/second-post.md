# The Paid Ad Nightmare Every Dispensary Knows

## Why Traditional Ads Fail Cannabis Businesses

🛑 **Platform Bans**:  
- 89% of dispensary ads rejected by Meta/Google  
- $2.3B in lost ad spend industry-wide last year  

💸 **Wasted Budgets**:  
- 72% of approved ads get zero reach due to shadowbanning  
- $18,000 average loss per failed campaign  

📍 **Location Chaos**:  
- "Near me" searches lead to competitors  
- Street addresses confuse navigation (45% wrong arrivals)  

> "We burned $50,000 on ads that never reached a single customer"
