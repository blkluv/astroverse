For years, legal dispensaries have faced an ironic challenge: Despite legalization, marketing cannabis remains stuck in the dark ages. Traditional social media and ad platforms treat cannabis businesses like illicit operations—shadow-banning content, restricting ads, and stifling growth.

The real obstacle? Not regulators, but outdated advertising gatekeepers preventing the industry from scaling.

From Firsthand Frustration to Future Solutions
As former CMO of NUGL (a 2020 Weedmaps competitor), I experienced these digital barriers firsthand. Today in 2025, blockchain, AI, AR, and NFTs dismantle these hurdles—finally enabling direct customer engagement.

The What3Words Breakthrough
Partnering with What3Words was a game-changer. After seeing global brands like Mercedes-Benz, Domino’s, and Walmart leverage their 3-word address system for hyper-local marketing, I recognized its potential for cannabis:

ZADDY (ZA Address): A dispensary’s 3-word location (e.g., ///KEEP.IT.SIMPLE)

Memorable for social media/billboards

Tradable as blockchain-based digital merch (NFTs)

Verifiable for in-store pickup via crypto receipts

How It Works
Customers buy a ZADDY NFT (linked to 3m² in-store merch)

Dispensaries validate NFTs on-chain for seamless redemption

Fans resell ZADDYs to promote their favorite shops—even offsetting merch costs

No more guesswork. Just precision marketing, provable ownership, and profit-sharing—all on blockchain.
