### **Our Solution: Gamified, No-Loss Predictions**

#### ðŸŒ¿ **Zero-Risk Participation**

- Get back your full stake + rewards for accurate predictions  

#### ðŸš€ **Viral Tokenomics**  
- Receive **"Memecoin Tokens"** (YES/NO meme coins) when voting  
  - **Winning tokens** stay rare (e.g., "YES-THCA-SunsetSherbert")  
  - **Losing tokens** inflate 19x (creating humorous collectibles)  
- Yield-generated buybacks boost winning token value  

#### ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Utility**
